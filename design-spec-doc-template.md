# Domain
This section describes in detail any complex components, algorithms, and data structures which may need to be leveraged, created, or modified in order to complete the given feature. If a problem might be solved in multiple ways, the different options may be proposed here and decided on as the document is reviewed. 

# Technical Details
This section describes the technical details of any new or modified systems, interfaces, or contracts which implementation of this feature will require. This may include definitions of web service endpoints, UI mockups, database table designs. Each system or interface should live in its own subsection.


# Test Specification
This section contains a list of tests which are to be used to ensure correct implementation of the designed feature. This may include subsections for Unit Tests, Automated Integration Tests, and Manual Tests depending on the scope of the feature.

# Implementation Estimates
This section should provide a basic breakdown of the feature into buckets, and then provide fibonacci estimates where 1 point is equal to Â½ day. These estimates will likely be further broken down into JIRA tickets following review of the specification document.
