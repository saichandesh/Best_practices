# Meaningful Names
1. Use descriptive and elaborate names
2. Don't use lists or queues or similiar data structures as part of the names
Eg : AccountList ( But actually those are n't list and also better not to encode the container type (like lists or queues) into the names )
3. Don't use the names that start with lower case "O" or "l" as they can tend to be read as zero or one
4. **Use Meaningful distinctions** : Don't use the names that have similar meanings such as two classes with Customer and CustomerObject doesn't make sense
5. **Use pronounceable names**
6.
